CS 401 Fall 2022 – homework 2

due: September 9, 11:59pm via Canvas

After doing this assignment, you should be able to:

write basic unit tests in JUnit
design test cases that will fail independently
The requirements for the assignment:

Define test cases for each of the find operations in 3b of hw1 – finding by type, growing zone, and common name
Assume the add function works
Include two test cases for each operation, one where there is at least one result, one where no results are found
Set up the list to include enough plants so that no case should return all of the plants
Define 2 unit tests for a find operation for the scientific name. This one will be a bit different from the common name search:
The search term has to be exactly two words (so there is whitespace in the middle of the string)
The search matches if each word is a prefix of the corresponding word in the database. Ex: a search term of “S semper” or “seq S” will match “Sequoia sempervirens”, but “equoia sempervirens” would not
Write code to cover these cases so they pass. [One common error people make when they start with unit tests is to write tests that you know will fail. You want to get all the test cases to pass.]
To submit, attach both your unit test files and your source files for the plant database – include those files even if you didn’t make changes. This will make it easier for me to run your test cases in case you used different class or method names.
Grading:

Test cases and additional code to get cases to pass 80% (40% for #1, 40% for #2 and 3)

Style 20% comments, naming. A simple explanation of the purpose of each test case is sufficient for comments. Give the test functions and test classes meaningful names. “Test1” is not a meaningful name, for example, but “findTrees” would be.
